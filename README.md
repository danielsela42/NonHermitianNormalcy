This is scratch work for testing viability of working with various non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
We were searching for a potential pattern or subset of Hamiltonians for which we could estimate the density of states from moments tr(H^m H*^n)
Unfortunately, any such Hamiltonians did not have a skin effect. 
The goal would have been to identify skin effect from just the moments, which we can compute counting loops.
